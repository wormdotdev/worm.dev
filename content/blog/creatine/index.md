description: Creatine - Amazing Benefits, Overhyped, or Dangerous?
---


Hey, meatsuits.

I'm of the opinion that most people should be taking creatine. I think a better question than "*Why*?" is "*Why not*?", but let's give it a try.

If you're an athlete, the benefits are significant in many respects. Better performance, more efficient workouts, faster recovery. See below for details.

If you are not an athlete: you still exercise, right? If you don't, then you are missing out on the most effective way to live healthier, longer, feel better and more capable, improve your mood, and many other benefits.

In other words, everybody should be exercising, and would then benefit from these aspects of creatine supplementation. Is that not enough? How about improved memory, reasoning, and resistance to the effects of stress and sleep deprivation? Possible benefits against ischemic/hypoxic events, and oxidative stress?

All for one of the lowest costs, and with the longest track record of safety of almost any supplement.

#### Creatine Benefits

- improved power/strength (5-15%)
- increased time to exhaustion during high intensity endurance activity [^Forbes2023].
- more lean mass in response to resistance training [^Delpino2022] [^Forbes2021]
- lower body fat [^Dinan2022]
- improves short term memory and intelligence/reasoning in healthy individuals, with potential benefit in the aging/stressed/sleep deprived [^Avgerinos2018] [^Sandkuhler2023] [^Prokopidis2023].
- possible benefits to a host of neurologic conditions and difficult to treat conditions like post-COVID fatigue, fibromyalgia [^Slankamenac2023].
- may increase tolerance to hypoxic/ischemic events like childbirth, heart attacks, and strokes [^Balestrino2016], mood disorders [^Candow2023], concussions [^Candow2023]
- relatively low cost for magnitude of benefit - one of the best "bang for your buck" supplements at around $0.31 per daily dose by my calculation at time of writing

#### Creatine Adverse Effects

Possible side effects include:

- slight weight gain as a result of fluid retention
- ![Creatine shits - Always Sunny](AlwaysSunny-CreatineShits.gif)

Just kidding - creatine shits not a common side effect. Creatine is extremely safe, well tolerated in even large doses.

There are situations where there is limited research on its safety like in advanced renal disease. Everyone should check with their doctor to discuss their personal health situation - this blog is not medical advice and everybody's situation is unique.

Let's get into the details, for those that are interested.

## What is creatine?

- an amino acid derivative, synthesized from **arginine**, **glycine** and **methionine**. So we make it from protein, but it is not a protein itself.

![Creatine reactions - (Kreider 2017) - CC BY-SA 4.0](creatine-reactions.png)

It is produced in the liver and kidneys, and because we can produce it, around 1-2 grams a day, it is not “essential” in our diet. However, supplementing has some significant benefits, as you will see, especially if your intake in food is low.

The biggest source in our diet is meat. A pound of uncooked beef or salmon contains about 1-2g of creatine (Kreider 2017). Most of us are not eating a pound of meat or fish per day.

Vegetarians, not surprisingly, generally have lower intramuscular creatine stores and may benefit more from supplementation.

What is its purpose in the body?

- When cells have a surplus of creatine and ATP (cellular energy source), ATP can donate a phosphate group to form phosphocreatine.  Phosphocreatine acts as an "energy buffer" to regenerate lost ATP. Supplying more creatine can bring cells closer to saturation, maximizing the ability to regenerate energy for intense activity.

## Dosing

So, if we are not getting enough or making enough, how much extra should we take?

Supplementation amount:

- common recommendations are for 3g in non-athletic adults, elderly, 5-10g for athletes
- some use a "loading phase" when first starting to take it, 5-10g 2-4 times per day for around a week

Supplementation can increase serum creatine concentration almost ten fold [^Kalhan2016].

What type of creatine to supplement?

- Creatine monohydrate. There are many other forms but no significant benefit.

Taking it with carbs and/or protein may be more effective.

There is a possible slight benefit to consuming post-exercise, but the magnitude and mechanism aren't clear (Ribeiro 2021). Speculated mechanisms include increased blood flow and nutrient transport triggered by exercise increasing delivery of creatine to muscles.

1-2% per day of the body's creatine stores are broken down daily and peed out in urine. Once levels are elevated, it takes about 4-6 weeks for creatine stores to return to baseline. (Kreider 2017)

## Benefits

How much benefit to strength?

- Multiple sources cite improvements to power/strength of 5-15%, slight improvements to sprint performance, with more benefit to repetitive sprints of 5-15%
- Increases time to exhaustion during high intensity endurance activity [^Forbes2023].
- Because of the improved work capacity and recovery, creatine supplementation also results in more gains in strength, muscle mass, and performance long term. Work harder in practice, without injury -> get better results.
- There is less benefit to endurance activities like swimming, jogging, cycling.
- Decreases inflammation, and oxidative stress, and may increase mitochondrial biogenesis [^Forbes2023].

Studied, possible benefits (thus far with limited evidence) in many more conditions:

- Post-COVID fatigue [^Slankamenac2023]
- Chronic fatigue syndrome [^Ostojic2021]
- Neurodegenerative conditions [^Candow2023]
- Fibromyalgia [^Alves2013]
- Brain and heart ischemia (strokes and heart attacks) [^Balestrino2016]
- Pregnancy and ischemia during delivery [^Dickinson2014]
- Mood disorders [^Candow2023]
- Concussions [^Candow2023]

## Safety

What is interesting to me about all of these clinical studies, as well, is that there have not been any significant adverse effects from supplementing creatine.

No supplement can be considered perfectly safe, so there may be something found down the road with long term clinical studies. But, so far I think the evidence is reassuring that the supplement is safe in the short to medium term for most people.

Unknowns start to be introduced with potential contaminants introduced in the manufacturing process, so there should be special caution about selecting the right manufacturer and whether the risks outweigh the benefits in certain populations, like children.

Can children take it safely?

- Probably, but it is not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
- I think that the biggest concern is not the creatine itself, if from a reliable source, but the potential additives or contaminants (like lead) in unregulated supplements and their effect on a developing body.

Let's talk about fears of kidney failure or kidney injury.

- How we measure kidney function: Creatinine (Cr) and GFR. GFR is calculated from Cr. Creatine supplementation raises Cr levels because Cr is a breakdown product of creatine.
- The creatine itself does not do any harm. Creatine supplementation and eating meat result in elevations of creatinine levels *because the body has more creatine it is breaking down*, not because it affects the kidneys' ability to filter the blood. Similarly, people with more muscle mass have a higher baseline Cr even with normal kidney function.

The one caveat to the above is that there is limited data on creatine use in the setting of existing renal dysfunction. There may be a pathway by which creatinine is broken down into other substances when concentration is high, that would not be a concern with healthy kidneys but *may* be in certain situations. It has not been studied, and so caution should be taken [^Longobardi2023]

Is it *completely* safe? Surely there must be a few actual adverse effects?

- weight gain

![[assets/AlwaysSunny-CreatineShits.gif]]

How much weight gain? About 0.5-1.0L of fluid retention is typical, so about the same in kilograms. (Kreider 2017)

- 95% of creatine is stored in muscles. Supplementation increases stored creatine, which has an osmotic effect. For those who have not taken chemistry or slept through that day of chemistry, water moves into areas that have more solute, AKA “other stuff dissolved in water". In this case, we are adding more stuff, the creatine, that pulls more water into muscles. They get bigger, and the body gains "water weight". Similar concept to when you eat a lot of carbs as carbohydrates are also brought into cells and bring some water along with them.

I know there is a lot of stigma about weight gain, but there are a few reasons why this is probably not as big of a deal as you think it is.

- 1. Creatine does not increase fat mass [^Antonio2021]. It's not adipose tissue that then has to be lost with a caloric deficit. It will go away when/if you stop supplementing creatine.
- 2. Muscles looking bigger tends to be more aesthetically pleasing than other kinds of weight gain. You "carry it" differently.
- 3. The water retention will cap when your cells are saturated with creatine.
- 4. It is not that much, compared to total body water and your baseline weight.

Am I at higher risk for muscle injury? Dehydration? Muscle cramping?

- No to all of the above. In fact, studies have demonstrated less incidence of cramping, heat illness, dehydration, muscle strain, total injuries, and missed practices in those taking creatine [^Kreider2017].

What about hair loss? There was that one study that showed increased DHT, right?

- One study showed an increase in DHT in rugby players given creatine [^vanderMerwe2009]. This result has not been replicated and there are many factors, including exercise, that may contribute to DHT fluctuations. In other studies, creatine has not been shown to affect testosterone (free or total), or DHT [^Antonio2021].

## Legality

Is it banned in any sports?

- No. There was controversy in the 1990s but it is impossible to ban supplementation because it is found in meat.

## Personal Experience and Wrapping Up

So, bottom line: should you take it?

Well, this blog is not medical advice. Keep in mind that long term data (more than 5 years) on the effects of supplementation are lacking, and creatine is not studied fully in many medical conditions, including renal disease. There may be an alternate pathway the body uses to metabolize creatine when it cannot excrete it, as in advanced renal disease.

I consider myself an amateur or hobbyist exerciser, not elite in any sport. I already took creatine even before this deep dive. Anecdotally, I notice a difference when I take it. I feel stronger and more capable in my workouts. I do feel like there is a little bit more "bulk" to my muscles, I suspect from a little bit of water retention, but it is nothing that anybody else likely notices or has commented on. I can say that I will continue to take it, and even more confidently after the research I've done here.

I can't speak to memory benefits. If they exist, for me they are subtle. There may not be enough clay to sculpt, there. One thing I do notice, because I work night shifts, is some slight resistance to mental fatigue toward the end of a 12 hour shift on a string of nights. Anecdotal, but it fits with some studies on the benefits of creatine in cognition and sleep deprivation.

## Brand and Formulation Recommendation

Any recommended brands or formulations?

- I personally take [Optimum Nutrition micronized creatine monohydrate](https://a.co/d/5Ixu1bk) (no affiliate link / not sponsored). There is also a [capsule form](https://a.co/d/fihJ455) that will be more expensive per serving but may be more tolerable. The powder is a little gritty but has minimal flavor and is easily swallowed in just a couple of ounces of water.
