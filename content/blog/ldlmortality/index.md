Interesting paper in the BMJ looking at the association between LDL levels and mortality in non-diabetic primary prevention patients.

**Primary prevention** aims to prevent the onset of a disease or condition. This includes measures like vaccinations, healthy lifestyle promotion (diet and exercise), and smoking cessation programs.

**Secondary prevention** focuses on early detection and treatment of a disease or condition to prevent it from worsening. Examples include regular screenings for cancer or cholesterol, and taking medication to manage high blood pressure.

**Tertiary prevention** aims to manage and rehabilitate individuals with an established disease or condition to improve their quality of life and reduce complications. This includes cardiac rehabilitation programs for people who have had a heart attack, and physical therapy for individuals with chronic pain.

### Study Type and Length

This is a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical record data from 4 January 2000 to 31 December 2022. The mean follow-up time was 6.1 years. 17% of patients had 10 or more years of follow-up.

### Key Results

* A U-shaped relationship was observed between LDL-C levels and mortality, with the lowest risk in the 100-189 mg/dL range.
* This optimal range is much higher than current recommendations for LDL-C levels.
* Total cholesterol (T-C) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio and triglycerides to HDL cholesterol ratio were more predictive of mortality than LDL-C alone.

### Comparison to Prior Research

* Conflicting results exist on the relationship between LDL-C and long-term mortality in primary prevention adults not on lipid-lowering therapy.
* Some meta-analyses indicate that high LDL-C is associated with at most a small increased absolute risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or premature mortality.
* Other studies have shown that acute coronary syndromes often occur in patients with 'normal' LDL-C.
* The life insurance industry, which focuses on predicting mortality, has found that the T-C/HDL-C ratio is a better predictor of all-cause mortality than LDL-C.
* This study's findings align with some previous research that has also shown a U-shaped relationship between LDL-C and mortality, with the lowest risk in a range higher than current recommendations.

### Limitations

* The study could not assess cause-specific mortality, which would have provided more insight into the relationship between LDL-C and cardiovascular disease mortality.
* The assessment of ASCVD risk was limited to events within the UPMC hospital system.
* There is a possibility of misclassification of statin use, as it was based on patient-reported data.
* The study may have residual confounding despite statistical adjustments.
