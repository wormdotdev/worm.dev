Interesting paper published in May 2024 by researchers from Nanjing University in China, looking at a possible probiotic candidate species *Blautia wexlerae*. Before we look at the details of the study, I want to talk a little bit about some background details for context.

First, some definitions:

> **Prebiotic**: Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that promote the growth of many types of microorganisms in the intestines. They are typically types of dietary fiber that humans cannot digest, but they serve as food for gut bacteria.

> **Probiotic**: Probiotics are live microorganisms that can be consumed in foods like yogurt, or fermented foods/drink (kombucha, kimchi, sauerkraut) or supplements.

> **Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)**: Short chain fatty acids are fatty acids with fewer than six carbon atoms. They are produced when the beneficial bacteria in the gut ferment prebiotic fibers. Common and relevant SCFAs include acetate, propionate, and butyrate.

We know quite a lot about the general benefits of eating a high fiber diet, and many of the benefits carry over into supplemental fibers like psyllium husk and inulin.

The clinical importance of specific probiotics are not as well known, though we are learning more every day. It is not as simple as "*Blautia* (or *Lactobacillus*, or any other species) bacteria are healthy and good for you so you should consume more of them."

You have probably heard the phrase, "The dose makes the poison.". Similarly, with probiotics, the dose, along with the location, host immune system, and the other species of the microbiome, make the pathogen. E. coli is a normal component of the gut microbiome, but is a common cause for human disease such as urinary tract infections. Streptococci and staphylococci are normal skin flora but are common sources of skin infections like cellulitis, abscesses. Clinically, we must be careful what bacteria, and the quantity, added to a potentially vulnerable organism like a human.

There is good research showing a few specific things tend to promote good health in most people, like short chain fatty acids (SCFA).
