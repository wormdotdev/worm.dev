Interesting paper published in May 2024 by researchers from Nanjing University in China, looking at a possible probiotic candidate species *Blautia wexlerae*. Before we look at the study findings, I want to talk a little bit about some background details for context.

First, some definitions:

> **Prebiotic**: Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that promote the growth of many types of microorganisms in the intestines. They are typically types of dietary fiber that humans cannot digest, but they serve as food for gut bacteria.

> **Probiotic**: Probiotics are live microorganisms that can be consumed in foods like yogurt, or fermented foods/drink (kombucha, kimchi, sauerkraut) or supplements.

> **Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)**: Short chain fatty acids are fatty acids with fewer than six carbon atoms. They are produced when the beneficial bacteria in the gut ferment prebiotic fibers. Common and relevant SCFAs include acetate, propionate, and butyrate.

We know quite a lot about the general benefits of eating **prebiotics**, aka a high fiber diet.

The clinical importance of specific **probiotics** are not as well known, though we are learning more every day. It is not as simple as "*Blautia* (or *Lactobacillus*, or any other species) bacteria are healthy and good for you so you should consume more of them."

You have probably heard the phrase, "The dose makes the poison.". Similarly, with probiotics, the dose, along with the location, host immune system, and the other species of the microbiome, make the pathogen. E. coli is a normal component of the gut microbiome, but is a common cause for human disease such as urinary tract infections and can result in invasive infection. Streptococci and staphylococci are normal skin flora but are common sources of skin infections like cellulitis, abscesses, as well as invasive infections like bacteremia. These are obviously not bacteria that people are supplementing, but just serve as examples of where clinically, we must be careful what bacteria, the route, and the quantity, added to a potentially vulnerable organism like a human.

Probiotics may not be universally safe to supplement [^Kothari2019], may not provide lasting effects [^Khalesi2019], or may result in varying but generally positive effects [^Barkhidarian2021]. What will it be in your or my specific circumstance? We do not fully know, yet, but the area is being heavily researched.

*Blautia*, it turns out, has some promise as a candidate for probiotic supplementation, but the trials showing safety and efficacy in different patient populations have not been done, yet. This genus of bacteria was not classified until 2008 [^Liu2008] and has since had some interesting research.

- Blautia less common in the gut of obese children, and even less common in the presence of both obesity and insulin resistance. The authors go so far as to suggest that Blautia may reduce inflammation causally linked to insulin resistance [^BenitezPaez2020].
- Building on the above study, in 2022 Japanese researchers discovered that *Blautia wexlerae* oral supplementation *in mice* induced anti-inflammatory changes that decreased high-fat diet induced obesity and diabetes [^Hosomi2022].
- Blautia species *negatively* associated with visceral fat accumulation [^Ozato2022].
- Blautia wexlerae improves obesity-associated male infertility *in mice* [^Zhong2024].
- One year of gluten free diet in celiac patients correlates increased Blautia with decreased markers of disease [^Costigan2024].
- Large vessel occlusion (big ischemic stroke) correlates with decreased Blautia abundance [^He2024].
- Decreased abundance of Blautia in children with autism spectrum disorder [^DeSalesMillan2024]. "Notably, a specific strain of Blautia, Blautia stercoris MRx0006, demonstrated significant effects in ameliorating social deficits, repetitive behaviors, and anxiety-like behaviors in a mouse model of ASD, further highlighting the potential relevance of the Blautia genus in ASD pathophysiology."
- Blautia glucerasea was found in 4-fold higher prevalence in individuals without MetS [^Witthoft2024].

And, the recent paper [^Rui2024] that prompted this post looked at several factors that promote Blautia wexlerae growth, finding essentially that:

- high fiber prebiotic foods and supplements promote B. wexlerae abundance

> Gut microbes produce SCFAs by metabolizing prebiotics on the one hand, and the SCFAs produced on the other hand can in turn promote the growth of specific microbes in the gut. Peterson et al. found that acetate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, propionate, and valerate significantly increased the abundance of B. wexlerae. Overall, most of the prebiotics that are difficult to be digested and absorbed by the host can be used by B. wexlerae to promote its growth [^Rui2024].

Suppose we want to try to favor Blautia growth without direct probiotic supplementation. What foods could we eat? The best way, currently, might be to consume a variety of high fiber foods, fruits and vegetables, which is consistent with existing advice for cultivation of a healthy microbiome - perhaps not a coincidence?

Let me know your thoughts/experiences in the comments. As always, be careful with unregulated supplements, and talk to your doctor for medical advice.
