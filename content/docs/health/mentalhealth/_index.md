## Important Low Effort Interventions

- Adequate Omega-3 Fatty Acid intake
- Adequate vitamin D

## Effortful Interventions

## Probiotics

Probiotics, or so-called "psychobiotics", have some research supporting benefits in depression, and cognitive impairment, with less success in schizophrenia and bipolar I. The most studied are *Bifidobacterium* and *Lactobacillus* strains such as *Bifidobacterium breve*, *Bifidobacterium longum*, and *Lactobacillus helveticus* [^Mosquera2024].

Evidence is currently limited, however, because of the uniqueness of every individual's microbiome and the number of possible probiotics available to test. It will take sophisticated studies to determine which strains are right for specific patient populations. Until then, it is a wild west of possible benefits, confounders, and potential harms.

## Vitamin D

Vitamin D has broad effects in the body, acting as a steroid hormone, modulating the expression of genes and resulting in a multitude of downstream effects including neutrotransmitter release, neurotrophic factors, and neuroprotection [^Ciobanu2023].

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with dementia, cognitive impairment, and a variety of mental health conditions. However, evidence that supplementation improves or reverses these conditions is lacking. This could be due to the difficulty in studying a vitamin/hormone that is already ubiquitous in our bodies and food, or it could mean that there are other factors that may be the cause of both cognitive and behavioral problems as well as lack of vitamin D.
