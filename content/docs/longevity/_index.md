## Tier 1 - Essentials

### [Avoid trans fats!](../nutrition/lipids/transfat.md)

- raise LDL, lower HDL, raise triglycerides, raise Lp(a), reduce LDL particle size, promote inflammation, cause endothelial dysfunction [^Mozzafarian2006]
- 2 percent increase in energy intake from trans fatty acids was associated with a 23 percent increase in the incidence of CHD [^Mozzafarian2006]
- The [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/trans-fat) did not regulate this in the USA until 2018. Though added trans fats for stability are now prohibited, trans fat contents in baked goods and dairy products, and ruminants are still [high](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat#Presence_in_food). If something contains less than 0.5 g of trans fat in a serving, it can be reported as trans fat free (in the US). This can be misleading if serving sizes are small, and in fact is a common reason for serving size manipulation.

### Exercise

- Avoid sedentarism - set a target of X steps per day, at least a few times a week, or [equivalent](https://getfit.mit.edu/sites/default/files/resource/Convert_activities_to_steps.pdf).
  - Every extra 1000 steps/day decreases all cause mortality by 15%, and 500 steps/day cardiovascular mortality by 7% [^Banach2023]. For pure mortality benefit, volume, not intensity, is what matters [^Paluch2021]. Benefits may plateau around 3 days/week [^Inoue2023] and around 6000-8000 (age 60+) or 8000-10000 (age <=60) steps [^Paluch2021].
- Do some vigorous exercise, if possible.
  - For each 1-[MET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent_of_task) increase in exercise capacity, your risk of death drops 12% up to 61% for those >9 METs [^Kokkinos2010].
- Resistance exercise can offer additional benefits
  - Decreased cardiovascular and total mortality up to 40-60 minutes/week [^Lee2023] but this benefit disappears and reverses as duration/week increases - needs more data.
  - Muscle strength decreases 12-15% per decade after age 50. Resistance training nursing home residents increased muscle strength 113% over 10 weeks [^Fiatarone1994] and improved gait speed and walk test distance [^Liu2011].

### Minimize supplemental sugars

### Adequate hydration

### Prefer whole foods over processed

&nbsp;

---

## Tier 2 - Optimization

- Minimize saturated fats, prefer mono- and poly-unsaturated where possible
- Where feasible, prefer plant proteins to animal proteins.

&nbsp;

---

## Optimizing for Exercise and/or Healthspan over Lifespan

- Protein intake 1.2 - 1.5 g/kg

&nbsp;

---

## Supplement Essentials

Supplements are secondary to whole food nutrition, but can be a valuable tool in some cases.

- Omega-3 if your diet is low in fish
- Vitamin D (if deficient or insufficient, which are common)

&nbsp;

---

## Supplement Optimization

- Creatine monohydrate
- Melatonin for sleep

This list is far from comprehensive. I have tried to list things with solid evidence for benefit, and avoid those where the data is unclear.

- Frailty defined by authors as: "a person over 65 years old who is vulnerable to any kind of change in health status, such as infection or physical injury. These individuals are at high risk of complications during a medical illness and have prolonged recovery times3. An international consensus report in 2006 characterized frail elders as having impairments in mobility, balance, strength, motor processing, cognition, nutrition, endurance (fatigue) and physical activity."
